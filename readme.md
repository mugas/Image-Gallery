# Description

First project that I did. Based on a tutorial as a simple image gallery.

* **Flexbox** - for the navbars, and also for the text inside the image
* **Grid** - for the gallery image. It is adapted to fit as many images as necessary keeping the ratio
* **Acessibility** - Add proper structure, image alt text and some other features to make the website more acessible.
* **BEM** - Use Block Element Modifier ( BEM) to name my classes in CSS
